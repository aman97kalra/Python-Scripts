## Functionality:
Script to scrap the top 10 news from IndiaToday.
I needed a script to fetch the top 10 news from a news site and the reason for choosing IndiaToday was that its DOM structure was easy to manipulate

## Libraries/Modules Required:
1) Requests
2) Beautiful Soup
3) Time

## Customizations Possible:
Just enter the site from where you want to scrape the news modify the dom structure according to the page.
Happy Coding !
