## Functionality:
Script to rename all the files in  a folder with a name of your choice. 
I needed a script to rename all the subtitle files of an anime series according to the episode number.

## Libraries/Modules Required:
1) Os

## Additional Note
The folder path should be absolute and without wildcard characters.

## Customizations Possible:
Just enter the folder whose files you want to rename and enter the new name / new sequence according to which you want to rename the files.
Happy Coding !
