## Functionality:
Script to post a customized Happy Birthday 'Person Name' message on the timeline of the person.
Just enter your email id and create a pwd.txt file containing password and see the magic.
Happy Coding!

## Libraries/Modules Required:
1) Requests
2) Selenium Webdriver
3) Selenium Keys
4) Time


## Additional Note: 
- We need to pass the instance of chrome webdriver to the function birthday_post to avoid closing the tab after execution.This is because the driver gets garbage collected as Objects will be collected once they are no longer referenced.
